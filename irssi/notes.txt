After (compiling and) installing Irssi, to start it, open a shell (Terminal) and type:

#       irssi                           -> start irssi

#       /set nick <nickname>            -> set nick name

#       /network                        -> see the current list of networks

#       /connect <network name>         -> connect to one of the networks

#       /quit                           -> quit irssi

#       /join #channelname              -> join a channel

#       /help <commandname>             -> help page in irssi


#       nc 127.0.0.1 1000               -> connect using nc

/connect <IP address> <port number> <password>

Yeah just have a basic server running first. 
Try to add a std::cout when you use the recv() function. 
When that's ready you can try to connect the client (irssi) to the server,
 and if it prints something like CAP LS 302 
 or anything that start with a CAP in the terminal 
 then you're on the right path

Yes use that /connect etc. in the irssi terminal

server args#     ./ircserv 6667 password

It can be any, we just used 6667 because it was kind of the default for irssi or maybe clients 
in general. If you don't have the authentication ready, you can just do /connect <IP address> (edited)
